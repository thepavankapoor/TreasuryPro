CRITICAL FIXES - World Bank Data + Yahoo Finance News Layout

=== ISSUE #1: World Bank Data Stuck on "Loading..." ===

PROBLEM: All economic indicators showing "Loading..." forever

ROOT CAUSE: Key mismatch between backend and frontend
- Backend had: 'gdp', 'inflation', 'unemployment', 'trade', 'debt'
- Frontend expected: 'GDP', 'CPI', 'Unemployment', 'Trade', 'Debt'

FIX:
✅ Changed backend keys to uppercase (GDP, CPI, etc.)
✅ Fixed date range to 2018-2024
✅ Increased data fetch to 20 items per request
✅ Fixed rawValue key (was raw_value)

=== ISSUE #2: News Section Plain Text ===

PROBLEM: News was plain cards, not Yahoo Finance style

FIX:
✅ Added tab navigation (All, News, Earnings, Press, SEC)
✅ Large 200x135px thumbnails with colored placeholders
✅ Horizontal card layout (image left, text right)
✅ Professional hover effects
✅ Click entire card to open article
✅ Better spacing and typography

=== FILES CHANGED ===

1. app.py - Fixed World Bank indicator keys and data fetching
2. index.html - Added news tabs and new structure
3. style.css - Added Yahoo Finance-style news CSS
4. script.js - Rewrote displayNews() for large cards with images

=== HOW TO UPDATE ===

1. Stop server (Ctrl+C)
2. Replace all 4 files
3. Restart: python app.py
4. Test: Search for AAPL, wait 40 seconds
5. Check Market Factors tab - should see data tables
6. Check Overview tab - should see Yahoo-style news

=== WHAT YOU'LL SEE ===

Market Factors Tab:
GDP, CPI, Unemployment, Trade, Debt tables with actual data
Values like $25.44T, 3.7%, etc. instead of "Loading..."

Overview - Latest News:
[All] [News] [Earnings] [Press] [SEC Filings]
Large news cards with colored thumbnails and headlines
